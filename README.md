# ColourMatcher
The Color Matcher Game is an engaging web-based game designed to test the 
playerâ€™s reaction time and cognitive abilities. The game challenges the player to 
match the displayed color name with the correct button color within a given 
time frame.

points. </li>

showing the player's final score. </li>
