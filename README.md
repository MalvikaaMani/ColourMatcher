# ColourMatcher
The Color Matcher Game is an engaging web-based game designed to test the 
playerâ€™s reaction time and cognitive abilities. The game challenges the player to 
match the displayed color name with the correct button color within a given 
time frame.
<h1> Game Mechanics </h1>
* The game displays the name of a color (e.g., "Red"), but the text color 
may differ from its meaning. 
* Players need to quickly click the button corresponding to the name of the 
color, not the text's color. 
* Each correct response awards points, while incorrect responses deduct 
points. 
* The game is timed, with a "Game Over" pop-up displayed at the end 
showing the player's final score. 
* Players can restart the game via the "Play Again" button.
